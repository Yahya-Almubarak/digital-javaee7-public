This is software to go with the book with ``The Java EE 7 Developer 
Handbook'' written by Peter A. Pilgrim, published by Packt Publishing. 
(September 2013) 



You can purchase a copy of the book from Packt Pub at this URL:

This source code distribution can be found on GitHub after the 
book's publication date:

(The code will be uploaded simultaneously with the book's 
publication date ;-)

COMPILATION
------------

Each of the chapters in the book has its own folder, and within those 
chapter folder there is at least one project folder with a Gradle 
project. You will recognize them, because they have a ``build.gradle' 
file inside them. This is the project build file. 


Go http://gradle.org/ and download Gradle version 1.6 or better

To compile the program

	% gradle build


Explicitly to just compile the sources, run this command line:

	% gradle compileJava


To clean the project and reset to the start, run this command line:

	% gradle clean




TEST
-----

Ask Gradle to run the Unit Tests with the following comand:

    % gradle test --info


Look for the results in the folder `build/reports' and view the HTML 
file inside a web browser or examine the XML test file. By the way all 
of the tests from the source code were written with JUnit. 




ECLIPSE
------------

Ask Gradle to (re-)create Eclipse project artifacts ``.classpath'' 
and ``.project''

    % gradle eclipse



IDEA
---------

Ask Gradle to (re-)create IDEA project configuration files ``*.ipr''
and ``*.iml'' etc

    % gradle idea



DEPENDENCIES
-----------------

You can ask a gradle project about its dependencies with the following:

    % gradle dependencies


And you can find out about the tasks that you can invoke with:

    % gradle tasks



OTHER ARTIFACTS
-----------------

Some project create WAR files. Gradle plugin for WAR files bind 
automatically `assemble'. This also applies to EAR and RAR files. So 
this implies that:


    % gradle assemble

Will do the right thing for certain projects. Here are some other 
useful Gradle tasks.

    % gradle jar        // for project that builds a JAR
    % gradle war        // ditto 
    % gradle ear        // ditto



ROOT GRADLE PROJECT 
----------------------

The root `build.gradle' file now can build the subprojects. It is 
NOT by any stretch of the imagination a standard Gradle 
multi-module project, however. Here are the necessary commands

Build just the initial project, here is the command:

    % gradle build



Build everything project in the Java EE 7 Developer Handbook example 
except for Chapter 11, use this command:

    % gradle build_everything 



To build and install all projects to the local Ivy repository:

    % gradle install_everything 



To clean all projects, run this following command: 

    % gradle clean_everything 


To clean and build projects, run this following command: 

    % gradle clean_build_everything 
    // equivalent to `gradle clean build'

    % gradle clean_install_everything
    // equivalent to `gradle clean install'


It certainly helps to know how to list out tasks in a Gradle project. 
To find about Gradle task, execute the following command:

    % gradle tasks --all




MISCELLANEOUS
----------------

I had to disable the multi-module nature of the root Gradle project, 
because it does not work intuitively for sub modules. With multi-module 
enables, running `gradle idea' for any of the sub module causes Gradle 
to copy all the other dependencies into that module, which is definitely 
not acceptable! 

Sadly, the only thing the root Gradle project can do is build a 
distribution ZIP file. If you don't belive me, I shared my problem with 
Luke Daley, the Gradleware committer and he told me that is the way 
Gradle works. 



    % gradle myZip

++++   LATE BREAKING NEWS   ++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At the last moment, I decided to split the XenTracker demonstration is 
two modes: modern and traditional. The first mode that I developed uses 
AngularJS (http://angularjs.org), a popular JavaScript framework and 
this is very modern. However I realized that this would be impedement to 
very new Java EE developer, who have just started to learn JavaServer 
Pages, JavaServer Faces and therefore I felt their learning would 
benefit a simplified page flow without AJAX. So please bear with me as I 
sort out the split. PS: I am doing post JavaOne 2013, conference and 
travelling around California. 



HINT:

Navigate to the `Embedded Container' project and build that one first. 
Execute the following commands from the project root directory

    % cd appendix01/glassfish-embedded
    % gradle clean
    % gradle install


The embedded container is used by many of the examples. I am sorry about 
this mess, because Gradle multi-module files do not behave exactly like
Maven modules. I counted on it when I was writing the book and then 
discovered this was the wrong approach for IDE's such as JetBrains IDEA.
